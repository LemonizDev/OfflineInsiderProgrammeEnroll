### Want to install Windows 11 on an unsupported PC using this?

**Step 1:** First things first, you'll have to open the script and enroll to the `beta` channel

**Step 2:** Open your windows settings (Shortcut key `Windows + I`) > go to update and security and check for updates

**Step 3:** Download the `appraiserres.dll` file from the windows 10 ISO, [click here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1kYUvivCNt4PKDhWof4E0WWqNsj5LpSQ-/view) to download it manually.

**Step 4:** When the windows 11 setup shows `this pc cant run windows 11` close the opened window > hit `windows logo key + R` type `C:\$WINDOWS.~BT\Sources` > Copy the `appraiserrs.dll` file that you just downloaded and paste in in this directory (replace with the original file if prompted)

**Step 5:** After doing this all you have to do is retry the update and everything should work well
